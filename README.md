# HipsterFill
Dummy text filler plugin for [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)!

@version: *0.7*

@todo:    
* see if selected layer is a text layer
* fix the resize issue (refresh?)

## How to use ?

Place the *HipsterFill.jstalk* in *~/library/application support/sketch/plugins*.

Use **ctrl + t** or the plugins menu and select *HipsterFill* to add filler text to a selected textbox.
When there is no internet connection available, a standard filler text will be provided.

NOTE: you need Sketch 2.1.2 or later.
